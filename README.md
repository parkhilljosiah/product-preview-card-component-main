### My Process

I started with a Mobile-First mentality, settling the HTML/JSX before moving into the CSS. I also used a React component to conditionally render the image based on the window screen size.

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
